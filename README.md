This project is a complete simulation of the parabolic motion of an object using <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plataforma_Java"><b>JAVA</b></a>, with knowledge of physical laws, simulation and programming. The aim is to provide a new learning tool for students who need to learn about the subject.

## üìö Requirements

- [Jcommon-1.0.16.jar](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjcommon1016jar.htm)
- [Jfreechart-1.0.13.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jfree/jfreechart/1.0.13)
- [JDK Version 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## üìå Features

- Real-time plot of parabolic motion in two dimensions (x and y axis).
- Form to enter values for initial velocity, launch angle. Obtaining calculations without a time and with a time.
- Calculation of the velocity and height of the object at any point along its trajectory.

## üî∞ Instructions for use

1. Download the project and open it in your preferred Java IDE (`Preferably IntelliJ IDEA`).
2. Make sure you have the `jcommon-1.0.16.jar` and `jfreechart-1.0.13.jar` libraries added to the classpath.
3. Execute the main class `Form`.
4. Use the form to enter the values for initial velocity, launch angle, initial height, and initial height.

## üåó Limitations

- The project does not take into account the rotation of the object.

## üñä Note 

This project was created for educational and research purposes and can be used for precise scientific or engineering purposes. However, if you want extreme precision it is recommended to validate the results obtained with other tools or experiments.
